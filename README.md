## **Project Overview**

I have worked on analyzing a dataset of over 20,000 sales records from an Amazon-like e-commerce platform. This project involves extensive querying of customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends using PostgreSQL. Through this project, I have tackled various SQL problems, including revenue analysis, customer segmentation, and inventory management.

The project also focuses on data cleaning, handling null values, and solving real-world business problems using structured queries.

An ERD diagram is included to visually represent the database schema and relationships between tables.
In this I have used 9 tables and the ERD diagram as shown below.

## **Database Setup & Design**

### **Schema Structure**

```sql
CREATE TABLE category
(
  category_id	INT PRIMARY KEY,
  category_name VARCHAR(20)
);

-- customers TABLE
CREATE TABLE customers
(
  customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,	
  first_name	VARCHAR(20),
  last_name	VARCHAR(20),
  state VARCHAR(20),
  address VARCHAR(5) DEFAULT ('xxxx')
);

-- sellers TABLE
CREATE TABLE sellers
(
  seller_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  seller_name	VARCHAR(25),
  origin VARCHAR(15)
);

-- products table
  CREATE TABLE products
  (
  product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,	
  product_name VARCHAR(50),	
  price	FLOAT,
  cogs	FLOAT,
  category_id INT, -- FK 
  CONSTRAINT product_fk_category FOREIGN KEY(category_id) REFERENCES category(category_id)
);

-- orders
CREATE TABLE orders
(
  order_id INT PRIMARY KEY, 	
  order_date	DATE,
  customer_id	INT, -- FK
  seller_id INT, -- FK 
  order_status VARCHAR(15),
  CONSTRAINT orders_fk_customers FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
  CONSTRAINT orders_fk_sellers FOREIGN KEY (seller_id) REFERENCES sellers(seller_id)
);

CREATE TABLE order_items
(
  order_item_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id INT,	-- FK 
  product_id INT, -- FK
  quantity INT,	
  price_per_unit FLOAT,
  CONSTRAINT order_items_fk_orders FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id),
  CONSTRAINT order_items_fk_products FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)
);

-- payment TABLE
CREATE TABLE payments
(
  payment_id	
  INT PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id INT, -- FK 	
  payment_date DATE,
  payment_status VARCHAR(20),
  CONSTRAINT payments_fk_orders FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id)
);

CREATE TABLE shippings
(
  shipping_id	INT PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id	INT, -- FK
  shipping_date DATE,	
  return_date	 DATE,
  shipping_providers	VARCHAR(15),
  delivery_status VARCHAR(15),
  CONSTRAINT shippings_fk_orders FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id)
);

CREATE TABLE inventory
(
  inventory_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  product_id INT, -- FK
  stock INT,
  warehouse_id INT,
  last_stock_date DATE,
  CONSTRAINT inventory_fk_products FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)
  );
```

## **Task: Data Cleaning**

 cleaned the dataset by:
- **Removing duplicates**: Duplicates in the customer and order tables were identified and removed.
- **Handling missing values**: Null values in critical fields (e.g., customer address, payment status) were either filled with default values or handled using appropriate methods.

---

## **Handling Null Values**

Null values were handled based on their context:
- **Customer addresses**: Missing addresses were assigned default placeholder values.
- **Payment statuses**: Orders with null payment statuses were categorized as “Pending.”
- **Shipping information**: Null return dates were left as is, as not all shipments are returned.

---

## **Objective**

The primary objective of this project is to showcase SQL proficiency through complex queries that address real-world e-commerce business challenges. The analysis covers various aspects of e-commerce operations, including:
- Customer behavior
- Sales trends
- Inventory management
- Payment and shipping analysis
- Forecasting and product performance
  

## **Identifying Business Problems**

Key business problems identified:
1. Low product availability due to inconsistent restocking.
2. High return rates for specific product categories.
3. Significant delays in shipments and inconsistencies in delivery times.
4. High customer acquisition costs with a low customer retention rate.

##  Business Problems
``` sql
1. Top Selling Products
Query the top 10 products by total sales value.
Challenge: Include product name, total quantity sold, and total sales value.


2. Revenue by Category
Calculate total revenue generated by each product category.
Challenge: Include the percentage contribution of each category to total revenue.


3. Average Order Value (AOV)
Compute the average order value for each customer.
Challenge: Include only customers with more than 5 orders.


4. Monthly Sales Trend
Query monthly total sales over the past year.
Challenge: Display the sales trend, grouping by month, return current_month sale, last month sale!


5. Customers with No Purchases
Find customers who have registered but never placed an order.
Challenge: List customer details and the time since their registration.


6. Least-Selling Categories by State
Identify the least-selling product category for each state.
Challenge: Include the total sales for that category within each state.


7. Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)
Calculate the total value of orders placed by each customer over their lifetime.
Challenge: Rank customers based on their CLTV.


8. Inventory Stock Alerts
Query products with stock levels below a certain threshold (e.g., less than 10 units).
Challenge: Include last restock date and warehouse information.

Challenge: Rank products by their profit margin, showing highest to lowest.


13. Most Returned Products
Query the top 10 products by the number of returns.
Challenge: Display the return rate as a percentage of total units sold for each product.

17. Top 5 Customers by Orders in Each State
Identify the top 5 customers with the highest number of orders for each state.
Challenge: Include the number of orders and total sales for each customer.


18. Revenue by Shipping Provider
Calculate the total revenue handled by each shipping provider.
Challenge: Include the total number of orders handled and the average delivery time for each provider.


19. Top 10 product with highest decreasing revenue ratio compare to last year(2022) and current_year(2023)
Challenge: Return product_id, product_name, category_name, 2022 revenue and 2023 revenue decrease ratio at end Round the result

Note: Decrease ratio = cr-ls/ls* 100 (cs = current_year ls=last_year)



Final Task
-- USING STORE PROCEDURE
create a function as soon as the product is sold the the same quantity should reduced from inventory table
after adding any sales records it should update the stock in the inventory table based on the product and qty purchased

## **Learning Outcomes**

This project enabled me to:
- Design and implement a normalized database schema.
- Clean and preprocess real-world datasets for analysis.
- Use advanced SQL techniques, including window functions, subqueries, and joins.
- Conduct in-depth business analysis using SQL.
- Optimize query performance and handle large datasets efficiently.

## **Conclusion**

This advanced SQL project successfully demonstrates my ability to solve real-world e-commerce problems using structured queries. From improving customer retention to optimizing inventory and logistics, the project provides valuable insights into operational challenges and solutions.

By completing this project, I have gained a deeper understanding of how SQL can be used to tackle complex data problems and drive business decision-making.
